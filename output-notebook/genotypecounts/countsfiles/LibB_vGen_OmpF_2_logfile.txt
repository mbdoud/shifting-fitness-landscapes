after parsing FASTQ_files, initially saw these distributions for barcode lengths -- but note that if a read had barcode lengths outside of 5-12 on either side, that read pair is discarded:
barcode 1 length distribution:
[(9, 3406106), (6, 3164631), (7, 3141879), (5, 3095758), (8, 3038113), (10, 2726322), (12, 2643363), (11, 2442604), (4, 13948), (13, 3234), (3, 1288), (2, 680), (1, 294), (0, 176), (14, 152), (16, 57), (18, 53), (36, 44), (17, 42), (15, 40), (25, 20), (31, 19), (115, 15), (44, 10), (27, 10), (46, 9), (22, 8), (24, 5), (20, 5), (35, 1), (43, 1), (19, 1)]
barcode 2 length distribution:
[(7, 3517633), (5, 3376525), (6, 3083400), (8, 2969397), (9, 2751492), (10, 2716423), (11, 2694753), (12, 2554809), (4, 7488), (13, 4201), (3, 1046), (2, 404), (14, 224), (1, 223), (0, 150), (16, 94), (20, 82), (21, 62), (18, 59), (19, 55), (28, 55), (15, 50), (17, 43), (33, 30), (25, 28), (22, 25), (24, 23), (40, 22), (103, 18), (38, 17), (32, 15), (29, 12), (35, 9), (30, 8), (26, 5), (27, 4), (34, 2), (48, 2)]
Discarded 0 reads that failed illumina filter

Out of 25088144 read pairs:
	purged 0,
	discarded 26008 for containing N,
	discarded 34548 for improper barcode length,
	discarded 1383248 for failed substring search.

Overall retained 23644340 read pairs containing 10732714 unique barcodes, prior to consensus building.

distribution of number of reads per observed barcode (note consensus was only built for >= 3 reads per barcode):
[(1, 8608763), (2, 737211), (9, 123010), (10, 122537), (8, 117329), (11, 115657), (7, 106898), (12, 105153), (3, 98929), (6, 93470), (13, 89424), (5, 79078), (14, 74111), (4, 68320), (15, 57501), (16, 43381), (17, 31126), (18, 21862), (19, 14597), (20, 9450), (21, 5915), (22, 3689), (23, 2126), (24, 1253), (25, 775), (26, 426), (27, 256), (28, 180), (29, 97), (30, 67), (31, 29), (32, 28), (33, 17), (34, 13), (35, 8), (37, 7), (38, 5), (39, 4), (36, 4), (46, 2), (42, 2), (56, 1), (48, 1), (40, 1), (43, 1)]

number of retained barcodes, ie, number of consensus sequences built: 1386740
