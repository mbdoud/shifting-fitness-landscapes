after parsing FASTQ_files, initially saw these distributions for barcode lengths -- but note that if a read had barcode lengths outside of 5-12 on either side, that read pair is discarded:
barcode 1 length distribution:
[(9, 4082246), (7, 3773474), (6, 3770289), (5, 3635835), (8, 3576223), (10, 3275649), (12, 3193793), (11, 2932989), (4, 16567), (13, 3952), (3, 1495), (2, 741), (1, 542), (14, 225), (0, 161), (16, 109), (15, 102), (24, 29), (17, 29), (19, 20), (18, 20), (29, 17), (33, 17), (21, 6), (27, 5), (38, 1), (36, 1)]
barcode 2 length distribution:
[(5, 4188422), (6, 4105666), (7, 3909249), (9, 3785456), (8, 3589303), (11, 3015312), (10, 2949469), (12, 2707579), (4, 7124), (13, 3227), (3, 1841), (2, 617), (1, 420), (0, 361), (14, 211), (19, 60), (17, 54), (15, 46), (20, 26), (16, 26), (21, 21), (27, 16), (24, 13), (39, 11), (35, 4), (34, 2), (18, 1)]
Discarded 0 reads that failed illumina filter

Out of 29503891 read pairs:
	purged 0,
	discarded 34546 for containing N,
	discarded 38116 for improper barcode length,
	discarded 1204808 for failed substring search.

Overall retained 28226421 read pairs containing 11013981 unique barcodes, prior to consensus building.

distribution of number of reads per observed barcode (note consensus was only built for >= 3 reads per barcode):
[(1, 7839318), (2, 1286982), (3, 246107), (9, 150415), (10, 149119), (8, 144249), (11, 140881), (7, 133021), (12, 126798), (6, 116451), (13, 109620), (4, 106312), (5, 102178), (14, 91449), (15, 73028), (16, 56340), (17, 42108), (18, 30829), (19, 21619), (20, 14930), (21, 10262), (22, 6867), (23, 4536), (24, 3076), (25, 2081), (26, 1378), (27, 944), (28, 695), (29, 569), (30, 403), (31, 290), (32, 217), (33, 189), (34, 147), (35, 106), (36, 89), (37, 72), (38, 43), (39, 39), (40, 37), (42, 29), (41, 26), (43, 21), (44, 20), (46, 11), (45, 11), (50, 9), (52, 8), (49, 8), (53, 7), (48, 7), (51, 5), (47, 5), (58, 3), (59, 2), (57, 2), (61, 2), (56, 1), (62, 1), (55, 1), (64, 1), (67, 1), (66, 1), (114, 1), (79, 1), (68, 1), (80, 1), (54, 1)]

number of retained barcodes, ie, number of consensus sequences built: 1887681
