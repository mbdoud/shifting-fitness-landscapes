after parsing FASTQ_files, initially saw these distributions for barcode lengths -- but note that if a read had barcode lengths outside of 5-12 on either side, that read pair is discarded:
barcode 1 length distribution:
[(9, 4342418), (7, 4009872), (6, 4007625), (5, 3860342), (8, 3814416), (10, 3464556), (12, 3403137), (11, 3108074), (4, 16909), (13, 3730), (3, 2054), (2, 1145), (1, 336), (14, 244), (0, 237), (15, 104), (16, 52), (18, 24), (17, 19), (21, 18), (25, 15), (24, 14), (33, 12), (27, 10), (20, 5), (28, 3), (19, 3), (29, 1)]
barcode 2 length distribution:
[(5, 4439824), (6, 4352770), (7, 4131841), (9, 4041645), (8, 3821680), (11, 3208502), (10, 3140564), (12, 2883938), (4, 7061), (13, 3361), (3, 1759), (2, 835), (1, 638), (0, 350), (14, 178), (15, 134), (17, 86), (18, 71), (16, 49), (19, 31), (29, 18), (24, 18), (20, 17), (32, 2), (40, 1), (44, 1), (22, 1)]
Discarded 0 reads that failed illumina filter

Out of 31349993 read pairs:
	purged 0,
	discarded 37049 for containing N,
	discarded 39543 for improper barcode length,
	discarded 1277569 for failed substring search.

Overall retained 29995832 read pairs containing 10874179 unique barcodes, prior to consensus building.

distribution of number of reads per observed barcode (note consensus was only built for >= 3 reads per barcode):
[(1, 7728578), (2, 1353440), (3, 247273), (11, 121757), (12, 121368), (13, 117401), (10, 117390), (14, 107693), (9, 107355), (8, 95966), (15, 95492), (16, 82269), (7, 82107), (4, 77738), (6, 69130), (17, 68830), (5, 60603), (18, 55581), (19, 43616), (20, 33056), (21, 24635), (22, 18137), (23, 13026), (24, 9250), (25, 6323), (26, 4392), (27, 3047), (28, 2138), (29, 1595), (30, 1150), (31, 800), (32, 603), (33, 473), (34, 382), (35, 315), (36, 248), (37, 178), (38, 136), (39, 116), (40, 112), (41, 83), (42, 72), (43, 70), (44, 48), (46, 36), (45, 33), (47, 23), (50, 14), (51, 13), (48, 13), (49, 12), (52, 12), (54, 11), (56, 5), (55, 5), (53, 5), (61, 4), (72, 4), (57, 4), (66, 2), (63, 2), (60, 2), (62, 2), (64, 1), (87, 1), (59, 1), (67, 1), (73, 1)]

number of retained barcodes, ie, number of consensus sequences built: 1792161
